# Technical Architecture

## React Native Frontend Stack

### Core Framework: React Native

### State Management: 
- Redux Toolkit with Redux Persist

### Navigation: 
- React Navigation v6

### Image Handling:
- React Native Fast Image for network images
- react-native-image-picker for camera/gallery access
- react-native-image-crop-picker for editing

### Forms and Validation:
- Formik for form management
- Yup for validation schemas

### Networking:
- Axios for REST API calls
- React Query for data fetching and caching

### Storage:
- AsyncStorage for non-sensitive data
- react-native-keychain for secure storage

### UI Components:
- React Native Paper or custom component library
- react-native-vector-icons for iconography

### Real-time Communication:
- Socket.io client for WebSocket connections

### Contacts Integration:
- react-native-contacts for accessing phone contacts

### Testing:
- Jest for unit testing
- React Native Testing Library for component testing
- Detox for end-to-end testing

## React Native Architecture

### Architecture Pattern
- Primary Pattern: Redux with Redux Toolkit
- Store configuration with slices for different domains (auth, posts, comments, friends)
- Thunks for async operations
- Redux Persist for offline state persistence

### Component Architecture:
- Functional components with React Hooks
- Container/Presenter pattern for complex screens
- Custom hooks for reusable logic

### Data Flow:
- Unidirectional data flow (Redux pattern)
- Immutable state updates
- Selector pattern for efficient rendering

### API Layer:
- Axios instance with interceptors for:
  - Authentication token management
  - Error handling
  - Request/response logging
- API service modules organized by domain

### Caching Strategy:
- React Query for API response caching
- Fast Image for image caching
- AsyncStorage for persisting non-sensitive data
- Secure storage for tokens and sensitive information

# Implementation Details

## Frontend Performance Considerations

### Image Optimization:
- Progressive loading
- Appropriate resolution for device
- Caching strategy for viewed images
- Lazy loading for timeline

### Feed Performance:
- Virtualized lists for memory efficiency
- Pagination for chronological feed
- Preloading next batch of images

### Offline Support:
- Basic offline viewing of cached content
- Queue posts/comments for sending when online
- Clear offline indicators

## Authentication & Data Security

### Token Management:
- Secure storage of authentication tokens
- Automatic token refresh
- Biometric protection option for app access

### Data Privacy:
- Secure contacts handling
- Clear permission requests
- Local encryption of sensitive data

## Real-time Features Implementation

### WebSocket Connection:
- Connection for real-time comment updates
- Notification delivery
- Connection state management and recovery

### Background Services:
- Push notification handling
- Background refresh for feed

## User Experience Considerations

### Accessibility
Requirements:
- Support for screen readers
- Adjustable text sizes
- Sufficient color contrast
- Alternative text for images

### Performance Targets
- Launch Time: Under 2 seconds
- Timeline Loading: Initial load under 1.5 seconds
- Image Loading: Progressive with 500ms initial render
- Comment Posting: Under 300ms perceived latency

### Internationalization
- Initial Languages: English
- Structure for Easy Translation: Use string resources
- Right-to-Left Support: Layout consideration for future RTL languages

## Integration with Backend

### API Integration

#### Authentication Endpoints:
